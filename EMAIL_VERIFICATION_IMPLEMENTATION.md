# ✅ Email Verification Implementation - FLED Teacher Login

## 📋 Overview
Implemented comprehensive email verification system to prevent fake/dummy email registrations and ensure only verified teachers can access the FLED dashboard.

## 🔐 What Was Changed

### 1. **Login Page (`public/teacher/login.html`)**

#### **Signup Process:**
- ✅ Imports `sendEmailVerification` from Firebase Auth
- ✅ After creating account, sends verification email automatically
- ✅ Sets user role to `'pending'` instead of `'teacher'`
- ✅ Adds `verified: false` flag to user document
- ✅ Signs user out immediately after registration
- ✅ Shows message: "Verification email sent! Please check your inbox..."

#### **Login Process:**
- ✅ Checks `user.emailVerified` status after sign-in
- ✅ Blocks login if email is not verified
- ✅ Shows warning message to check inbox
- ✅ Calls Cloud Function to promote verified users to 'teacher' role
- ✅ Only allows access if role is `'teacher'` and email is verified

### 2. **Firestore Security Rules (`firestore.rules`)**

#### **New Functions Added:**
```javascript
function isEmailVerified() {
  return request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email_verified == true;
}

function isVerifiedTeacher() {
  return isEmailVerified() && 
         exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'teacher';
}
```

#### **Enhanced Security:**
- ✅ All teacher operations now require `isVerifiedTeacher()` instead of just `isSignedIn()`
- ✅ Users can create account documents but cannot access teacher features until verified
- ✅ Email verification status checked at database level
- ✅ Role must be 'teacher' to access sections, students, attendance, tasks, messages

### 3. **Cloud Functions (`functions/index.js`)**

#### **New Function: `promoteVerifiedTeachers`**
```javascript
exports.promoteVerifiedTeachers = onCall(async (request) => {
  // Checks if user's email is verified
  // Updates Firestore role from 'pending' to 'teacher'
  // Adds verified: true and verifiedAt timestamp
  // Returns success/failure status
});
```

**Purpose:**
- Automatically promotes users from `'pending'` to `'teacher'` role after email verification
- Called during login process for verified users
- Ensures role assignment happens server-side (secure)

## 🚀 User Flow

### **New User Registration:**
1. User fills signup form (name, email, password)
2. System creates Firebase Auth account
3. **Verification email sent automatically**
4. User document created with `role: 'pending'` and `verified: false`
5. User signed out immediately
6. Redirected to login with message to check email

### **Email Verification:**
1. User receives email from Firebase
2. Clicks verification link
3. Email status updated in Firebase Auth
4. User can now log in

### **First Login After Verification:**
1. User enters email and password
2. System checks if email is verified
3. If verified, Cloud Function promotes role to 'teacher'
4. User granted access to dashboard
5. If not verified, blocked with warning message

### **Subsequent Logins:**
1. Email verification check passes
2. Role is already 'teacher'
3. Immediate access to dashboard

## 🔒 Security Benefits

### **Prevents Fake Accounts:**
- ❌ Cannot use disposable email addresses without verification
- ❌ Cannot use non-existent email addresses
- ❌ Cannot access system without proving email ownership

### **Server-Side Role Assignment:**
- ✅ Role promotion happens via Cloud Function (Admin SDK)
- ✅ Cannot be bypassed by client-side manipulation
- ✅ Firestore rules enforce verification at database level

### **Multi-Layer Protection:**
1. **Client-side:** Login page checks `user.emailVerified`
2. **Server-side:** Cloud Function validates before role assignment
3. **Database-side:** Firestore rules require `email_verified == true`

## 📝 User Messages

### **After Registration:**
```
"Verification email sent! Please check your inbox and verify your email before logging in."
```

### **Login Without Verification:**
```
"Please verify your email before logging in. Check your inbox for the verification link."
```

### **Login With Pending Role:**
```
"Access denied. Your account is pending approval. Please try again later."
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Test New Registration:**
1. Go to login page
2. Click "Create an account"
3. Fill in details with real email
4. Submit form
5. ✅ Should see verification message
6. ✅ Check email inbox for verification link
7. ✅ Click link to verify
8. ✅ Try logging in - should succeed

### **Test Unverified Login:**
1. Register new account
2. **Don't** click verification link
3. Try to log in
4. ✅ Should be blocked with warning message

### **Test Existing Verified User:**
1. Log in with verified account
2. ✅ Should work normally
3. ✅ Role automatically promoted if needed

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### **1. Deploy Firestore Rules:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### **2. Deploy Cloud Functions:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### **3. Deploy Hosting (login page):**
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### **Or deploy everything:**
```bash
firebase deploy
```

## 📊 Database Structure

### **User Document (Unverified):**
```javascript
{
  uid: "abc123",
  email: "teacher@example.com",
  name: "Jane Doe",
  role: "pending",           // ← Not yet a teacher
  verified: false,           // ← Email not verified
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

### **User Document (Verified):**
```javascript
{
  uid: "abc123",
  email: "teacher@example.com",
  name: "Jane Doe",
  role: "teacher",           // ← Promoted after verification
  verified: true,            // ← Email verified
  verifiedAt: Timestamp,     // ← When they verified
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

## 🔧 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### **Add "Resend Verification" Button:**
```javascript
// Add button to login page for users who didn't receive email
async function resendVerification() {
  const user = auth.currentUser;
  if (user && !user.emailVerified) {
    await sendEmailVerification(user);
    showAlert('Verification email resent!', 'success');
  }
}
```

### **Admin Approval System:**
- Add admin panel to manually approve teachers
- Require both email verification AND admin approval
- Send notification when admin approves account

### **Email Customization:**
- Customize verification email template in Firebase Console
- Add FLED branding and instructions
- Configure email sender name
