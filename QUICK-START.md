## ðŸš€ Next Steps (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Node.js (if not already installed)

Since npm wasn't found, you need to install Node.js:

**Option A: Using Homebrew (recommended for Mac)**
```bash
# Install Homebrew if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Node.js
brew install node

# Verify installation
node --version
npm --version
```

**Option B: Download from nodejs.org**
1. Visit https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the LTS version (v20.x)
3. Run the installer
4. Restart your terminal

---

### Step 2: Install Notify Server Dependencies

```bash
cd "/Users/jhonrussellrodriguez/Downloads/wFled copy 5/notify-server"
npm install
```

You should see:
```
added 87 packages
```

---

### Step 3: Start the Notify Server

**Option A: Using the start script**
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

**Option B: Manual start**
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$(pwd)/service-account.json"
npm start
```

You should see:
```
âœ“ Firebase Admin initialized
ðŸš€ Notify server running on http://localhost:3001
```

**Keep this terminal window open!** The server needs to run continuously.

---

### Step 4: Deploy Your Web App

Open a **NEW terminal window** and run:

```bash
cd "/Users/jhonrussellrodriguez/Downloads/wFled copy 5"
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

After deployment completes, you'll see:
```
âœ”  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/fledd-2e273/overview
Hosting URL: https://fledd-2e273.web.app
```

---

### Step 5: Test FCM Token Registration

1. Open your deployed site: **https://fledd-2e273.web.app/teacher/login.html**
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Click **Sign in with Google**
5. When browser asks "Allow notifications?" â†’ Click **Allow**
6. Watch the console for these messages:
   ```
   Service Worker registered
   FCM Token obtained: e7Qx...
   FCM token saved to Firestore
   ```

7. **Verify in Firestore:**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/fledd-2e273/firestore)
   - Open **Firestore Database**
   - Navigate to `users` collection
   - Find your user document
   - Confirm `fcmTokens` array exists with your token:
     ```javascript
     fcmTokens: [
       {
         token: "e7Qx1234567890...",
         device: "Chrome on Mac",
         addedAt: "2024-10-19T..."
       }
     ]
     ```

---

### Step 6: Send a Test Notification

1. **Get your Firebase ID token:**
   - In the browser console (on your deployed site), run:
     ```javascript
     firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken().then(token => console.log(token))
     ```
   - Copy the long token string that appears

2. **Send test notification using curl:**
   - Open a **NEW terminal window**
   - Run this command (replace YOUR_ID_TOKEN with the token you copied):
   
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ID_TOKEN_HERE" \
     -d '{
       "title": "ðŸŽ‰ FLED Notification Test",
       "body": "If you see this, notifications are working perfectly!",
       "studentIds": []
     }'
   ```

3. **Expected result:**
   - You should see a browser notification pop up!
   - Response in terminal:
     ```json
     {
       "success": true,
       "stats": {
         "totalTokens": 1,
         "successful": 1,
         "failed": 0
       }
     }
     ```

## ðŸŽ¯ What Works Now

After completing these steps:

âœ… Teachers can log in with Google
âœ… Browser automatically requests notification permission
âœ… FCM tokens are saved to Firestore
âœ… Notify server can send push notifications
âœ… Notifications appear even when browser is in background
âœ… Invalid tokens are automatically cleaned up

---

## ðŸ”„ Daily Usage

### Starting the Notify Server

Whenever you restart your computer, you'll need to start the notify server:

```bash
cd "/Users/jhonrussellrodriguez/Downloads/wFled copy 5/notify-server"
./start.sh
```

Keep this terminal window open while working on FLED.

### Deploying Updates

After making changes to your web app:

```bash
cd "/Users/jhonrussellrodriguez/Downloads/wFled copy 5"
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

---

## ðŸ“± Next Phase: Parent Mobile App

Once web notifications are working, you'll:

1. Create Flutter mobile app for parents
2. Add FCM token registration on parent login
3. Parents receive notifications on their phones
4. Same notify server handles both web and mobile!

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

**"npm: command not found"**
- Install Node.js using the instructions in Step 1

**"Service account not found"**
- Check that `service-account.json` exists in the notify-server folder
- Run from the correct directory

**Notification not received**
- Check browser notification permissions (click lock icon in address bar)
- Ensure VAPID key is correct in `firebase.js`
- Verify FCM token exists in Firestore
- Check notify server logs for errors

**CORS errors**
- Make sure you're testing on the deployed site (https://), not localhost
- Notify server has CORS enabled by default

**"Unauthorized" error**
- Get a fresh ID token (they expire after 1 hour)
- Make sure you're signed in
