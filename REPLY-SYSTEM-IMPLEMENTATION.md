# Simple Reply System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a two-way communication system allowing parents to reply to teacher messages and teachers to respond back.

## Features Added

### 1. Reply Button on Message Cards
- Added "View Replies" button with chat icon to each message card
- Badge showing reply count (e.g., "3" for 3 replies)
- Button only shows badge when replies exist

### 2. Message Replies Modal
Located in `section.html`, includes:

#### Original Message (Pinned at Top)
- Blue card showing the original message
- Displays: Subject, Message content, Timestamp
- Remains visible while scrolling through replies

#### Replies Thread
- Shows all replies in chronological order
- Each reply displays:
  - **Sender Name** with role badge (Teacher/Parent)
  - **Color coding**: Blue for teachers, Green for parents
  - **Icon**: person-badge for teachers, person-check for parents
  - **Timestamp**: Formatted date and time
  - **Content**: Reply message text

#### Reply Input Form
- Textarea for typing replies
- "Send Reply" button
- Form clears after successful submission

### 3. Real-Time Updates
- Uses Firestore `onSnapshot()` listener
- New replies appear automatically without page refresh
- Works for both teacher and parent replies
- Listener cleaned up when modal closes

### 4. Reply Functionality

#### viewMessageReplies(messageId)
- Loads message and all existing replies
- Displays in modal
- Sets up real-time listener

#### displayReplies(replies)
- Renders reply thread
- Shows "No replies yet" message when empty
- Color-codes replies by role

#### Reply Form Handler
- Validates reply content
- Gets teacher name from user document
- Creates reply object with:
  ```javascript
  {
    content: string,
    senderName: string,
    senderUid: string,
    role: 'teacher' | 'parent',
    timestamp: serverTimestamp()
  }
  ```
- Updates message document using `arrayUnion(reply)`

## Data Structure

### Message Document
```javascript
{
  subject: string,
  message: string,
  recipientType: string,
  sectionId: string,
  ownerUid: string,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  replies: [  // NEW FIELD
    {
      content: string,
      senderName: string,
      senderUid: string,
      role: 'teacher' | 'parent',
      timestamp: timestamp
    }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

### For Teachers (Web Dashboard)
1. Go to Section â†’ Messages tab
2. Click "View Replies" button (chat icon) on any message
3. Modal opens showing:
   - Original message at top
   - All existing replies
   - Reply input form at bottom
4. Type reply and click "Send Reply"
5. Reply appears immediately (real-time)
6. Badge on message card updates with new count

### For Parents (Mobile App - To Be Implemented)
1. Receive push notification for new message
2. Open message in app
3. See "Reply" button or reply icon
4. Tap to open reply thread
5. View original message and all replies
6. Type and send reply
7. Real-time updates show teacher responses

## Next Steps

### 1. Update Firestore Security Rules
Need to add rules allowing parents to read and reply to their messages:

```javascript
match /messages/{messageId} {
  allow read: if isTeacher() || 
    (request.auth != null && 
     request.auth.uid in resource.data().recipientUids);
  
  allow create: if isTeacher();
  
  allow update: if isTeacher() || 
    (request.auth != null && 
     request.auth.uid in resource.data().recipientUids &&
     request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['replies']));
  
  allow delete: if isTeacher();
}
```

### 2. Mobile App Implementation (Flutter)
Add to message detail screen:
- Reply button
- Reply thread display
- Reply input field
- Real-time listener for new replies

Example code:
```dart
// Listen for replies
FirebaseFirestore.instance
  .collection('messages')
  .doc(messageId)
  .snapshots()
  .listen((snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.exists) {
      final replies = snapshot.data()?['replies'] ?? [];
      setState(() {
        _replies = replies;
      });
    }
  });

// Send reply
Future<void> sendReply(String content) async {
  final reply = {
    'content': content,
    'senderName': currentUser.name,
    'senderUid': currentUser.uid,
    'role': 'parent',
    'timestamp': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  };
  
  await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('messages')
    .doc(messageId)
    .update({
      'replies': FieldValue.arrayUnion([reply])
    });
}
```

### 3. Push Notifications for Replies
Update `notify-server` to send FCM notifications when:
- Parent replies to teacher message â†’ Notify teacher
- Teacher replies back â†’ Notify parent

Add to notification payload:
```javascript
{
  title: 'New Reply',
  body: `${senderName} replied to: ${messageSubject}`,
  data: {
    type: 'message_reply',
    messageId: messageId,
    replyContent: replyContent.substring(0, 100)
  }
}
```
